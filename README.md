# RIBY
Tips for **Ruby 3.0** in *powerpc-os400*

----
When I was in High School I was quite good at Maths and I was often asked for help by classmates.
My nickname was *Riby*, out of my family name.

That's why I decided to name this GitHub repository **RIBY**: it is here to help the few that would be so courageous to face the hurdles of installing
Ruby gems in **IBM i PASE**.
Riby also has a curious assonance with **Ruby**, the programming language we will leverage on.

I would suggest an [IBM i chroot](https://github.com/IBM/ibmichroot) approach so you do not risk compromising any of your existing PASE configurations.

But let us start from the beginning, I will add content gradually based on the feedback of the... class!

The most recent content will be on top of the README so, if you will join later on, start reading from the bottom (or follow the index).

Let's go!
