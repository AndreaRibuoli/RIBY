# RIBY
Tips for **Ruby 3.0** in *powerpc-os400*

----
When I was in High School I was quite good at Maths and I was often asked for help by classmates.
My nickname was *Riby*, out of my family name.

That's why I decided to name this GitHub repository **RIBY**: it is here to help the few that would be so courageous to face the hurdles of installing
Ruby gems in **IBM i PASE**.
Riby also has a curious assonance with **Ruby**, the programming language we will leverage on.

I would suggest an [IBM i chroot](https://github.com/IBM/ibmichroot) approach so you do not risk compromising any of your existing PASE configurations.

But let us start from the beginning, I will add content gradually based on the feedback of the... class!

The most recent content will be on top of the README so, if you will join later on, start reading from the bottom (or follow the index).

Let's go!

2. [to refurbish the flat](#2-to-refurbish-the-flat)
3. [to install Ruby 3.0](#3-to-install-Ruby-3.0)

### 1. to pave the way

If you do not have experience with **IBM i chroot** I would suggest you to practice a bit.
I assume you already have installed **yum** in your PASE environment so that installing IBM i chroot will be straightforward:

```
yum install ibmichroot
``` 

Creating a chroot is as simple as (the `-y` options means *Auto respond yes to the prompts*):

```
chroot_setup -y /QOpenSys/chRootRiby
``` 

Now, yum supports an option (`--installroot`) that allows us to specify a chroot (already created) as the target for our installation:
we will use it to prepare the safe environment to experiment with Ruby 3. 
First of all we install in the chroot the **yum** package itself (with its dependencies) so that we will be able to issue the next installations from the chroot:

```
yum -y --installroot=/QOpenSys/chRootRiby install yum ca-certificates-mozilla
```

We also add the package *ca-certificates-mozilla* because it will be useful later on.

Yum handles all dependencies and we will end up installing more that forty pachages! One of these is *bash* so that entering the chroot we can actually use the newly installed **bash** shell:

```
chroot /QOpenSys/chRootRiby /QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash
```
----
### 2. to refurbish the flat

At the end of the first step we entered our newly created chroot for the first time.

We had previously installed *yum* so it is available to list installed packages:

```
yum list installed
```

but not to install extra packages (`yum repolist all` returns *repolist: 0*)


We can notice there are some refinements required:

* if we execute `cd $HOME` we will notice that current user's home needs to be created in the chroot (`mkdir $HOME`, `chmod 0755 $HOME`)
* the */tmp* directory is missing the *sticky bit* (execute `chmod +t /tmp`)
* the */QOpenSys/etc/yum* is incomplete: */QOpenSys/etc/yum/repos.d* directory is missing so that no yum repository is identified (`mkdir /QOpenSys/etc/yum/repos.d`)

**Note**: in order to configure yum repository enter 5250 and 

CPY OBJ('*/QOpenSys/etc/yum/repos.d/ibm.repo*') TODIR('*/QOpenSys/chRootRiby/QOpenSys/etc/yum/repos.d*')

Now, if we repeat the `yum repolist all` we get:

```
bash-4.4$ yum repolist all
repo id                              repo name                         status
ibm                                  ibm                               enabled: 661
repolist: 661
```

----
### 3. to install Ruby 3.0

In the previous steps we organized a confortable home for our Ruby installation. 
I organized a yum repository to host current and future builds of Ruby interpreter.

To configure access to the mentioned repository we will use **git**:

```
yum -y install git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/AndreaRibuoli/RIBY.git
```

```
cp ./RIBY/andrearibuoli.repo /QOpenSys/etc/yum/repos.d/ibm.repo
```

```
yum -y install ruby-devel
```

```
ruby -v
```

Here we are: you have **Ruby 3.0 interpreter installed in an IBM i PASE chroot!**
